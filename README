# BalanceFunction

Some simple code for balance function analysis in ALICE

To run main analysis code, edit CreateAlienHandler.C as needed, then do aliroot runGrid.C to test/submit/merge

Calculate*.C macros analyze the output histogram file to produce text files

Draw*.C macros read in the text files and make plots (external data files not provided in repo)
